# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  

For "Soft Skills for the Win? by Jared Braggins"
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jared.braggins2936/viz/JobHistory_15568444434680/Skills_Dashboard


    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
 
        Accessible:
        This visualization is not accessible to all readers, especially those with a lower resolution screen or smaller screen size.  The lines are quite thin and it is hard to make out which line belongs to which skill.  This is also caused by the same color that is used for all the soft-skills lines.  

        The color of the full-time jobs and contract/temp jobs (dark teal and light teal) may not be very distinguishable to those who have green-blind problems.  

        The second line of the text is a bit cut off in the lines like "Studied English Literature at Victoria University" (the words "at Victoria University" is cut).  These are important information for the readers and should be shown fully.

        Reproducible:
        This visualization is not very reproduceable, as there is no clear data on what skills was used for which job.  This information was deducted from the lines that were shown.  

        Equitable:
        The data shown here is strictly for a personal resume.  Even though it is not a great visualization, it does bring out the concern that the job seekers that have more technology and visualization tools accessible to them, will have the opportunity to create a viz to attract the recruiter's attention.  That would put those who do not have access to these tools at a disadvantage.


    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
  
        We can choose higher-contrast colors for the different types of jobs.  For example, red, white and black instead of the current yellow, light teal and dark teal.  Make sure the text that were cut off are shown in full.

        To make it more reproduceable, perhaps a link to the resume, or a table showing which job and what skills are used can be added as a link on the visualization.  



   

For "Boston Women Voters by Branden Kornell"
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bkornell/viz/BostonWomenVoters/BostonWomenVoters


    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        
        Accessible:
        The size of the map and the densely populated dots on it are not very accessible.  The lack of zoom features on the map makes it impossible to examine each voter in details in densely populated area.  The font used are generally a little too small, especially the y-axis of the bar graphs, and the words "WARD BOUNDS SHOWN IN RED" on the map lower right corner.  

        Reproducible:
        At first glance, it seems the data can be reproduceable, since the details of each voter is shown when hovered over the voter's dot on the map, including all the demographic information shown in the bar graphs on the left side.  However, as mentioned above, because the map is too small and not zoomable, it is impossible to hover over every single voter's dot to get the information.  Thus, this viz is not reproduceable.

        Equitable:
        This viz includes data for all women from all demographic status (birth country, marital status, occupation) who have registered to vote in the 1920 election.  This seems to be equitable.  It is worth mentioning that they even recorded the ones who have no occupation, or have no occupation recorded.


    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  

        We can add a zoom feature for the map so that it is possible to see the details of every voter if someone chooses to.  Bigger fonts should be used in the places mentioned above. 
        
        The zoom feature will also make the viz reproduceable because it will be possible to get the data for every voter on the map.


- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
